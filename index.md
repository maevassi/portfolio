  - We’ve all heard an anecdote on someone’s (maybe our own!) birth weight before. A baby being very lightweight and tiny or heavy and chunky, either being a source of worry or hope in a parent’s story.

Many factors influence the outcome of a pregnancy and the baby’s birth weight. I’m interested in the relationship between gestation time and birth weight and then whether smoking affects the gestation time and the birth weight.

The data set contains information about 1,236 male’s birth weight, date, and gestational period collected as part of the Child Health and Development Studies in 1961 and 1962. Information about the baby’s parents — age, education, height, weight, and whether the mother smoked is also recorded. The original dataset has 22 variables, but I will focus on three variables :

The length of gestation in days;

The birth weight in ounces;

Whether the mother smoked or not.

It’s important to note that all babies in this dataset are considered “live births”, meaning they survived at least 28 days.

## Wrangling The Simpsons
- A separate subsection for each STAT228 mini-project with:
  - The project title
  - A 1–2 sentence summary of the project
  - Introduction & Setup
In this simple andinteractive data wrangling tutorial, you will learn how to:

use filter() and arrange() to manipulate rows;
use select(), mutate() and summarize() to manipulate and create columns;
use join() to join tables together;
use ggplot()to visualize data.
We will use the Simpson Dataset from Kaggle which is composed of simpsons_characters, simpsons_episodes and simpsons_script_lines, respectively containing character details, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes. It was originally pulled by Tod Schenider in 2016 and uploaded by William Cukierski.

By the end of the tutorial, you’ll be able to comment on:
- which season of the Simpsons has the highest IMDb rating;
- how has the IMDb ratings changed over the seasons;
- which character has the most spoken lines across all episodes;
- whether there is a relationship between word count and IMDb rating?
