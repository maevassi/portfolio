## STAT228 Projects
### Mini-Project 1: Cigarettes and Contractions
  - Many factors influence the outcome of a pregnancy and the baby’s birth weight. This project focuses on the relationship between gestation time and birth weight and then whether smoking affects the gestation time and the birth weight using data about 1,236 male’s birth weight, and gestational period collected as part of the Child Health and Development Studies in 1961 and 1962.

### Mini-Project 2: Wrangling The Simpsons
  - An interactive data wrangling tutorial on how to use functions from tidyr, dplyr and ggplot2 to manipulate rows and columns and visualize data, using a dataset containing character details, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 episodes of The Simpsons.

### Final Project: Who Checkmated? - Predicting the winner of a chess game
  - Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. This project tries to predict if a game resulted in a black or white winner depending on the player level using a Chess Game Dataset with just over 20,000 games collected from a selection of users from the free open source chess server Lichess.org.
